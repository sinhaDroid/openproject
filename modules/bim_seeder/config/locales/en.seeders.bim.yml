                  In this wiki you can collaboratively create and edit pages and sub-pages to create a project wiki.

                  **You can:**

                  *   insert text and format it with the toolbar,
                  *   insert text and images with copy and paste,
                  *   paste formatted text directly from MSOffice documents,
                  *   create a page hierarchy by inserting parent pages,
                  *   use makros to include, e.g. table of contents, work packages lists or Gantt charts,
                  *   include wiki pages in other text fields, e.g. project overview or meetings,
                  *   reference tickets with one, two or three "#"+ticket number, depending on what information should be displayed,
                  *   include links to other documents,
                  *   view the change history,
                  *   view as Mardown.
